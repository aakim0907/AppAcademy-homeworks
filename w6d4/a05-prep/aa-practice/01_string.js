// Write a String#symmetric_substrings method that returns an array of substrings
// that are palindromes, e.g. "cool".symmetric_substrings => ["oo"]
// Only include substrings of length > 1.


// Back in the good old days, you used to be able to write a darn near
// uncrackable code by simply taking each letter of a message and incrementing it
// by a fixed number, so "abc" by 2 would look like "cde", wrapping around back
// to "a" when you pass "z".  Write a function, `caesar_cipher(str, shift)` which
// will take a message and an increment amount and outputs the encoded message.
// Assume lowercase and no punctuation. Preserve spaces.
// To get an array of letters "a" to "z", you may use `("a".."z").to_a`. To find
// the position of a letter in the array, you may use `Array#find_index`.


// Write a method that translates a sentence into pig latin. You may want a helper method.
// 'apple' => 'appleay'
// 'pearl' => 'earlpay'
// 'quick' => 'ickquay'


// Returns an array of all the subwords of the string that appear in the
// dictionary argument. The method does NOT return any duplicates.


// Write a method that capitalizes each word in a string like a book title
// Do not capitalize words like 'a', 'and', 'of', 'over' or 'the'
